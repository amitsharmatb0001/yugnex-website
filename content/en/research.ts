        body: "You might ask: \"Why not ship something now?\" Because foundational technology can't be rushed. When Google built their search algorithm, they didn't ship incrementally. When OpenAI trained GPT-3, they didn't release GPT-0.5 first. When SpaceX designed reusable rockets, they didn't start with \"partially reusable.\" We're building AI that makes engineering decisions. That requires a level of reasoning, context-awareness, and reliability that doesn't exist in current systems. We're taking the time because the problem deserves it.",
