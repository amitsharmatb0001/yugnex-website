    {
        question: "When can I try it?",
        answer: "We're in advanced prototype phase with launch planned for later this year. Join our waitlist for early access."
    },
    {
        question: "Is this another code completion tool?",
        answer: "No. We're building systems that understand and reason about entire software architectures."
    },
    {
        question: "Why should I believe this is possible?",
        answer: "Because AI capabilities have reached the threshold where true software reasoning is feasible. We've filed patents on the core innovations. The question is execution, not possibility."
    },
    {
        question: "Are you hiring?",
        answer: "Currently focused on core R&D. Future opportunities will be announced."
    },
    {
        question: "What makes you different from Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or other AI coding tools?",
        answer: "Those are assistance tools. We're building autonomous engineering systems. The difference is reasoning vs. generation."
    },
    {
        question: "Will this replace developers?",
        answer: "No. Software engineering requires human judgment, creativity, and context that AI can't replace. Our platform augments engineers, handling the cognitive load of system understanding so you can focus on higher-level decisions."
    },
    {
        question: "How does it handle proprietary codebases?",
        answer: "Your code stays yours. We're building for on-premise and private cloud deployment with full data sovereignty. No code leaves your infrastructure without your explicit permission."
    },
    {
        question: "What languages/frameworks does it support?",
        answer: "We're starting with the most widely-used languages and frameworks. Specific support matrix will be announced closer to launch."
    },
    {
        question: "Can it work with legacy systems?",
        answer: "Yes. In fact, legacy systems with minimal documentation are where architectural understanding becomes most valuable. The platform reconstructs architectural intent from the code itself."
    },
    {
        question: "What's the learning curve?",
        answer: "If you can use your current IDE, you can use our platform. We're designing for zero friction adoption."
    },
    {
        question: "Is my code used for training?",
        answer: "No. Your code is never used for training. The platform analyzes your specific codebase to understand its unique architecture—your IP stays completely private."
    },
    {
        question: "How is this different from AI pair programming?",
        answer: "AI pair programming tools predict what you'll type next. We understand what your changes will do to the entire system. It's the difference between tactical assistance and strategic understanding."
    },
    {
        question: "When exactly will it launch?",
        answer: "2026, when it's ready for production use. We're not rushing to market with demos—we're building systems that work reliably in real-world conditions."
