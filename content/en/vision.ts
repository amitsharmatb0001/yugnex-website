        "We are entering a new era where software engineering is no longer limited by human cognitive bandwidth or the ephemeral nature of current tools.",
        "YugNex represents the bridge between the 'Yug' (epoch) of human-only engineering and the 'Nex' (next) era of collaborative, autonomous systems.",
        "Our vision is to create a persistent digital intelligence that understands software not just as text, but as a living, evolving system—preserving intent, context, and reasoning across the entire lifecycle.",
        "We believe the future of software lies in the symbiotic relationship between human creativity and machine continuity, where AI doesn't just assist, but truly engineers alongside us."
